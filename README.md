# YAC Sim - Yet Another Cache Simulator
### Simulates a cache with user defined attributes and simulates accesses from user input.
Created for the purposes of Computer Organization (CS-225) course CSD, University of Crete.

## How To Use YAC Simulator
### Before running the simulator executable:  
The simulator executable can be run with a configuration file as argument e.g.: **./yac_sim config.txt**  
the configuration file can contain all memory and cache parameters(see below), use **config.txt** as an example
to create your own configurations.  
If the configuration file does not specify all the parameters the user will be prompted 
to input them after running the simulator.  

### After running the simulator executable:  

- Insert the memory parameters: 
  1. **Memory Size** in **Bytes** 
  2. **Word Size** in **Bytes, should be less than Memory Size**  
  
- Insert the cache parameters:
   1. **Cache Size** in **Bytes**
   3. **Block** (Line) **Size** in **Bytes**
   2. **Associativity**,1 is direct mapped up to 16 associativity levels

Now the user can insert different addresses or some commands for the simulation.  
Î‘ddresses can be inserted through the command line (one by one) or by a file.  

### Available commands:
- **source < filename >**:  Reads addresses from a file with a given filename and reports Hits & Misses.  
- **display**:  Displays the contents of the Cache and the Statistics (Hit/Miss Ratio).  
- **clear**:  Clears the contents of the Cache and the resets the Stastistics  
- **cmd**:  Display the available commands  
- **exit**: Display the Statistics and exits the YAC Simulator  
- **Typing a valid address in decimal** e.g. "100" YAC Sim will simulate the access of that address
